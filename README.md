# Chessing Game

Welcome to **Chessing Game**! This is my first project written in C, where I explore the fundamentals of programming, algorithms, and game logic. The project is aimed at creating a chess game that can be played on the command line. It is designed as a learning experience with plenty of lessons learned along the way.

## Project Overview

The Chessing Game is a basic implementation of the chess board game using C. It features a simple console-based interface where users can play chess against each other. The game implements all the basic rules of chess, including movements of different pieces, check/checkmate logic, and turn-based gameplay.

## Features

- **Chessboard Display**: The chessboard is displayed in a readable format using text characters.
- **Piece Movement**: Players can move pieces based on the standard rules of chess.
- **Turn-Based Play**: The game alternates turns between the two players.
- **Basic Validation**: Validates moves based on the type of piece and the rules of chess (e.g., pawns moving forward, knights jumping in L-shape).
- **Check and Checkmate Detection**: The game checks for checkmate conditions.

## Lessons Learned

This project served as a great opportunity to learn and reinforce my understanding of C programming. Some of the key lessons Iâ€™ve learned so far include:

- **Pointers and Memory Management**: Understanding how to manage game state and piece movements through pointers.
- **Arrays and Data Structures**: Using arrays for the chessboard and organizing data to represent chess pieces.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Building the logic for piece movement, turn alternation, and win conditions.
- **Modular Code Design**: Breaking down the program into smaller functions for readability and maintainability.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Learning how to debug and test the game by simulating various chess scenarios.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
